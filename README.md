## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/lucertgvby/phat/releases). Once downloaded, execute the installer to set up the application on your system.

## Usage

1. Click on the "Upload" button.
2. Select the email file you want to analyze.
3. View the parsed results displayed on the screen.
4. Check the highlighted fields and security insights for further analysis.

## How It Works

Phat operates by reading the email headers from the specified file formats. It utilizes PowerShell scripts to extract relevant information, which is then presented in an easy-to-read format. The application highlights important fields, allowing users to quickly assess the email's legitimacy.

## Supported Formats

Phat currently supports the following email formats:

- `.eml`: Standard format for email messages.
- `.msg`: Microsoft Outlook email message format.

## Understanding Email Security

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF helps verify that the email comes from an authorized server. It prevents spoofing by checking the sender's IP address against a list of authorized IPs.

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM adds a digital signature to the email header. This signature verifies that the email content has not been altered during transit.

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM. It allows domain owners to set policies on how to handle emails that fail authentication checks.
